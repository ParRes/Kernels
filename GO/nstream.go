/// NAME:    nstream
///
/// PURPOSE: To compute memory bandwidth when adding a vector of a given
///          number of double precision values to the scalar multiple of
///          another vector of the same length, and storing the result in
///          a third vector.
///
/// USAGE:   The program takes as input the number
///          of iterations to loop over the triad vectors, the length of the
///          vectors, and the offset between vectors
///
///          <progname> <# iterations> <vector length> <offset>
///
///          The output consists of diagnostics to make sure the
///          algorithm worked, and of timing statistics.
///
/// NOTES:   Bandwidth is determined as the number of words read, plus the
///          number of words written, times the size of the words, divided
///          by the execution time. For a vector length of N, the total
///          number of words read and written is 4*N*sizeof(double).
///
/// HISTORY: This code is loosely based on the Stream benchmark by John
///          McCalpin, but does not follow all the Stream rules. Hence,
///          reported results should not be associated with Stream in
///          external publications
///
///          Converted to C++11 by Jeff Hammond, November 2017.
///          Converted to Go by Jeff Hammond, July 2020.
