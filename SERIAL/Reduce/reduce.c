NAME:    reduce

PURPOSE: This program tests the efficiency with which a pair of 
         vectors can be added in elementwise fashion. 
  
USAGE:   The program takes as input the length of the vectors and the 
         number of times the reduction is repeated, 

         <progname> <# iterations> <vector length> [<algorithm>]
  
         The output consists of diagnostics to make sure the 
         algorithm worked, and of timing statistics.

FUNCTIONS CALLED:

         Other than standard C functions, the following 
         functions are used in this program:

         wtime()
