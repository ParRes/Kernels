NAME:    Branch

PURPOSE: This program tests the effect of inner-loop branches on
         application performance. We investigate four cases. The first
         three all concern light-weight loops, i.e. loops that have
         very few instructions associated with them.
         1) branches inside vectorizable loops where the branch does
            not necessarily inhibit vectorization: vector_go
         2) branches inside vectorizable loops where the branch does
            inhibit vectorization: vector_stop
         3) branches inside non-vectorizable loops: no_vector
         4) branches inside non-vectorizable loops in which each branch
            corresponds to a sizeable and different set of instructions:
            ins-heavy

CONSTRAINTS:
         - the code should be continuously scalable, i.e. the user should
           be able to specify the amount of work to be done.
         - the code should be verifiable.
         - the code should be executable with and without branches, with 
           otherwise identical amounts of work, to assess the impact of the 
           branches.
         - the performance of the code should be dominated by the work in
           the loops, not by memory bandwidth required to fetch data. This 
           means that arrays should fit in cache, and any loop over arrays 
           should be executed many times to amortize the initial memory load 
           costs and to remove noise from the timings.
         - any arrays used should be initialized only once, to avoid confusing
           performance impact of initialization with that of the branches. 
           Because the base loop over the array is short, it completes very
           quickly, leading to very noisy results if it were timed separately.
           Hence, we must time the ensemble of all iterations over the base
           loop, which would include reinitializations if present.
         - the branches should be "unpredictable," meaning that if the compiler
           guesses them to be always taken or to be always not taken, it will
           be wrong often. Otherwise the cost of a mispredicted branch may
           not show up in the performance results.
         - the amount of work in the codes containing the three different
           types of light-weight loops should be the same to allow fair
           comparisions.
         - the code should not not produce overflow or underflow. 
         - the actual cost of computing the branch condition should be small,
           so that we can assess the cost of the occurrence of the branch as
           it disrupts vectorization and the hardware pipelines). If the
           condition were expensive to compute and we run the code with and
           without the branch, the performance difference would be exaggerated.
         - Note: Casts from integer to float or double are not always vectorizable. 

APPROACH:
         - to avoid casts and keep conditionals inexpensive and exact, we use 
           only integer operations. 
         - we make sure that the numerical results of the codes for the
           different branch structures and for the different paths following
           the branch are identical.
         - conditionals are simple comparisons to zero of quantities that
           are computed anyway.
         - initialization produces a saw-tooth pattern with frequent sign
           crossings to defeat speculative branch execution.
         - successive iterations over a relatively short array result simply
           in a change of sign of all array elements, so that the results are
           bounded, and verification values are easily computable.

USAGE:   The program takes as input the length of the
         vector loop, the number of repetitions of the loop, and the type of 
         branching

         <progname> <# iterations> <vector length> <branch_type>
  
         The output consists of diagnostics to make sure the 
         algorithm worked, and of timing statistics.

FUNCTIONS CALLED:

         Other than standard C functions, the following 
         functions are used in this program:

         wtime()
         fill_vec()
         func*()
