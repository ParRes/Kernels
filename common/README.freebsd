This is a rather terse summary of what is required to build the PRKs on FreeBSD.

# Necessary Packages

BSD make isn't GNU make, which the PRK assumes.

sudo pkg install gmake

I assume GCC works fine as it does on Linux but I tested LLVM.
OpenMP target is not supported by LLVM 6.0.1 so those compilations will fail.

sudo pkg install clang flang libpgmath

## C++ dependencies

sudo pkg install opencl-2.2_1 
sudo pkg install devel/clinfo devel/ocl-icd lang/beignet lang/pocl
sudo pkg install tbb
sudo pkg install boost-all

You will need to acquire triSYCL and Intel Parallel STL via GitHub.
One minor issue with triSYCL was addressed by patching triSYCL.
I suspect this issue disappears with LLVM 7.0 but you can look up
the issue with `std::optional` on GitHub if necessary.

RAJA and Kokkos were not tested.
