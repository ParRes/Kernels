******************************************************************

This files contains instructions for building and running PRKs using
the Charm++, OpenSHMEM, Grappa, or Fine-Grain MPI runtimes.

These runtimes need to be  installed, and you need to specify in file
PRKROOT/common/make.defs where they are located. Note that if Charm++,
OpenSHMEM or Grappa are built on top of MPI, MPI does need to be
installed, even if it is not called directly.

Grappa
------

This runtime requires cmake to install. Compile and link flags depend
on the particulars of the installation and cannot be specified
uniformly. Hence, it is necessary to obtain them from the Grappa
installation, after building it. This is done automatically by
including an autogenerated make include file from the Grappa
installation directory.  Grappa programs are best run using standard
MPI tools like mpiexec.hydra, with the usual command line parameters.
Before building or running Grappa code, source bin/settings.sh from
the Grappa installation directory.

Charm++
-------
The run script charmrun may not give the desired result. If Charm++
is built to use MPI, the code can be run in most cases by using
mpiexec.hydra, with the usual command line parameters.

Fine-Grain MPI
--------------
Care must be taken to use the specific MPI version supporting this
runtime, which must be built explicitly. Codes are run using the
Fine-Grain MPI version of mpiexec.hydra. This name may well clash
with the version of mpiexec.hydra supporting standard MPI. Such a
conflict may be avoided by starting a sub-shell for FG_MPI runs and
changing path variables only inside that shell. Scripts in the
PRKROOT/Run directory employ this technique automatically and do
not need to be modified for proper execution.
