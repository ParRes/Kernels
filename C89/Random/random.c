NAME:    RandomAccess

PURPOSE: This program tests the efficiency of the memory subsystem to 
         update elements of an array with irregular stride.

USAGE:   The program takes as input the 2log 
         of the size of the table that gets updated, the ratio of table size 
         over number of updates, and the vector length of simultaneously
         updatable table elements. 

         <progname> <#update ratio> <log2 tablesize> <vector length>

FUNCTIONS CALLED:

         Other than standard C functions, the following 
         functions are used in this program:

         wtime()
         PRK_starts()
         poweroftwo()

NOTES:   This program is derived from HPC Challenge Random Access. The random 
         number generator computes successive powers of 0x2, modulo the 
         primitive polynomial x^63+x^2+x+1. The principal differences between 
         this code and the HPCC version are:
         - we start the stream of random numbers not with seed 0x1, but the 
           SEQSEED-th element in the stream of powers of 0x2.
         - the timed code applies the RandomAccess operator twice to the table of 
           computed resuls (starting with the same seed(s) for "ran" in both 
           iterations. The second pass makes sure that any update to any table 
           element that sets high-order bits in the first pass resets those bits 
           to zero.
         - the verification test now simply constitutes checking whether table
           element j equals j.
         - the number of independent streams (vector length) can be changed by the 
           user.

         We note that the vectorized version of this code (i.e. nstarts unequal 
         to 1), does not feature exactly the same sequence of accesses and 
         intermediate update values in the table as the scalar version. The 
         reason for this is twofold.
         1. the elements in the stream of powers of 0x2 that get computed outside 
            the main timed loop as seeds for independent streams in the vectorized 
            version, using the jump-ahead function PRK_starts, are computed inside 
            the timed loop for the scalar version. However, since both versions do 
            the same number of timed random accesses, the vectorized version must
            progress further in the sequence of powers of 0x2.
         2. The independent streams of powers of 0x2 computed in the vectorized 
            version can (and will) cause updates of the same elements of the table 
            in an order that is not consistent with the scalar version. That is, 
            distinct values of "ran" can refer to the same table element 
            "ran&(tablesize-1)," but the operation 
            Table[ran&(tablesize-1)] ^= ran will deposit different values in that 
            table element for different values of ran. At the end of each pass over 
            the data set, the table will contain the same values in the vector and 
            scalar version (ignoring the small differences caused by 1.) because of 
            commutativity of the XOR operator. If the update operator had been 
            non-commutative, the vector and scalar version would have yielded 
            different results.
