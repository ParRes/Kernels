NAME:    RefCount

PURPOSE: This program tests the efficiency of exclusive access to a
         pair of non-adjacent private reference counters
  
USAGE:   The program takes as input the total number of times each
         thread updates its the reference counters, and the number of 
         threads involved.

               <progname>  <# threads><# iterations>
  
         The output consists of diagnostics to make sure the 
         algorithm worked, and of timing statistics.

FUNCTIONS CALLED:

         Other than OpenMP or standard C functions, the following 
         functions are used in this program:

         wtime()
         bail_out()
