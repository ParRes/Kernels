# NAME:    dgemm
#
# PURPOSE: This program tests the efficiency with which a dense matrix
#          dense multiplication is carried out
#
# USAGE:   The program takes as input the matrix order,
#          the number of times the matrix-matrix multiplication 
#          is carried out.
#
#          <progname> <# iterations> <matrix order>
#
#          The output consists of diagnostics to make sure the 
#          algorithm worked, and of timing statistics.
#
# HISTORY: Written by Rob Van der Wijngaart, February 2009.
#          Converted to Python by Jeff Hammond, February 2016.
