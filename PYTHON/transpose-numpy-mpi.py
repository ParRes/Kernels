# NAME:    transpose
#
# PURPOSE: This program measures the time for the transpose of a
#          column-major stored matrix into a row-major stored matrix.
#
# USAGE:   Program input is the matrix order and the number of times to
#          repeat the operation:
#
#          transpose <# iterations> <matrix_size>
#
#          The output consists of diagnostics to make sure the
#          transpose worked and timing statistics.
#
# HISTORY: Written by  Rob Van der Wijngaart, February 2009.
#          Converted to Python by Jeff Hammond, February 2016.

#                     Layout nomenclature
#                     -------------------
#
# - Each rank owns one block of columns (Colblock) of the overall
#   matrix to be transposed, as well as of the transposed matrix.
# - Colblock is stored contiguously in the memory of the rank.
#   The stored format is column major, which means that matrix
#   elements (i,j) and (i+1,j) are adjacent, and (i,j) and (i,j+1)
#   are "order" words apart
# - Colblock is logically composed of #ranks Blocks, but a Block is
#   not stored contiguously in memory. Conceptually, the Block is
#   the unit of data that gets communicated between ranks. Block i of
#   rank j is locally transposed and gathered into a buffer called Work,
#   which is sent to rank i, where it is scattered into Block j of the
#   transposed matrix.
# - When tiling is applied to reduce TLB misses, each block gets
#   accessed by tiles.
# - The original and transposed matrices are called A and B
