# NAME:    Stencil
#
# PURPOSE: This program tests the efficiency with which a space-invariant,
#          linear, symmetric filter (stencil) can be applied to a square
#          grid or image.
#
# USAGE:   The program takes as input the linear
#          dimension of the grid, and the number of iterations on the grid
#
#                <progname> <iterations> <grid size>
#
#          The output consists of diagnostics to make sure the
#          algorithm worked, and of timing statistics.
#
# HISTORY: - Written by Rob Van der Wijngaart, February 2009.
#          - RvdW: Removed unrolling pragmas for clarity;
#            added constant to array "in" at end of each iteration to force
#            refreshing of neighbor data in parallel versions; August 2013
#          - Converted to Python by Jeff Hammond, February 2016.
