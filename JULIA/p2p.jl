# NAME:    Pipeline
#
# PURPOSE: This program tests the efficiency with which point-to-point
#          synchronization can be carried out. It does so by executing
#          a pipelined algorithm on an m*n grid. The first array dimension
#          is distributed among the threads (stripwise decomposition).
#
# USAGE:   The program takes as input the
#          dimensions of the grid, and the number of iterations on the grid
#
#                <progname> <iterations> <m> <n>
#
#          The output consists of diagnostics to make sure the
#          algorithm worked, and of timing statistics.
#
# FUNCTIONS CALLED:
#
#          Other than standard C functions, the following
#          functions are used in this program:
